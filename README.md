## Background

Due to the political unrest in Hong Kong, an increasing number of Hongkongers are looking overseas to settle down for a few years. For some reason, they are particularly interested in the city of Ames. 

As a scientist working in a relocation/migration firm in Hong Kong, you have been tasked to build a model which can predict the expected sale price of houses in that area based on its features. Since the potential buyers are NOT intending for these houses to be their forever homes, they will hope to get the houses at a good price so that they do not loose too much money when they eventually sell it.

## Problem Statement
To build an accurate model to predict the expected saleprice of a house in Ames.

## Methods

#### Background Research
To identify known factors which affect house sale prices.

#### Datasets
The Ames Housing dataset was used. This dataset contains information from the Ames Assessorâ€™s Office used in computing assessed values for individual residential properties sold in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010.

This version of the dataset includes 2051 observations with 82 features.

#### Data Processing
Missing data was converted to appropriate scores or categories. All features were checked to be within the prescribed range, or having the correct categories according to the data dictionary. Features were transformed where appropriate (e.g. ordinal to continuous scale, log transformations). Datapoints that were extreme outliers were dropped.

#### Analysis
Summary statistics for all variables were computed. Data distributions were visualised using  histograms. Relationships between the predictors and house sale prices were assed via scatterplots and correlations

Linear Regression and regularisation techniques(Lasso, Ridge and ElasticNet) were used to build a home saleprice prediction model. Accuracy of the model was determined through cross validation, mean squared error (mse) and root mean squared error (rmse) scores. Models with a lower mse and rmse are more accurate. Model building was performed in a step-wise process where poor features were first dropped before adding new features.

| Model    | Variables included                       | Ridge(cvs) | Lasso(cvs) | Ridge        | Lasso        |
|:---------|------------------------------------------|------------|------------|--------------|--------------|
|          |                                          | train data | train data | holdout data | holdout data |
| Model 1  | Base features supported by research      | 26980      | 27431      | 28580        | 28541        |
| Model 2  | All other numeric features + Model 1     | 25972      | 25906      | 22878        | 23196        |
| Model 3  | All other categorical features + Model 2 | 21239      | 21272      | 24347        | 24015        |
| Model 3I | Model 3 minus poor performing features   | 22867      | 22848      | 24022        | 23897        |
| Model 4  | Model 3I plus select polynomial features | 18592      | 18739      | 19948        | 19477        |
| Model 4I | Model 4 minus poor performing features   | 17470      | 17691      | 21202        | 20758        |

cvs = cross validated score<br/>
all scores are root mean square errors


The above models were built and the corresponding root mean square errors are displayed. In general, subsequent models are better than their predeccessors and there is little evidence of overfitting for each model.

## Conclusion and recommendations
The models above will be able to predict the saleprice of houses to reasonable accuracy. We would reccomend users to use Model 4I using enet regression to predict sale prices as it has the best accuracy.

If future staff need to develop other models for a price prediction model in other neighborhoods with little time or resources, it is reccomended to start with variables similar to that in the base model (Model 1). This will require the least number of variables for a reasonable model.
